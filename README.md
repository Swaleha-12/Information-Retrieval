# Homework 4: Information Retrieval
# CS 201 Data Structures II, Spring 2020

-------

This homework explores information retrieval through implementations of trie and inverted index.

Skeleton code is provided.

## Purpose

This homework provides insight into the trie and invertedindex data structures as well as into the field of informationr etrieval.

## Background

For this assignment, you should
- understand the trie data structure and its related operations
- understand the inverted index data structure and its related operations
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably python
- be able to problem solve

## The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw4.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement.

Based on feedback from the last set of students that attempted this assignment, the number of hours that your team will require to complete this homework are as follows.
- _data unavailable_

## Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _rubric.csv_.

## Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

### 4.1 Solving the Problem Set

Please solve the problems as indicated in the problem set and push the relevant files to your GitHub repository. Any files in the repository at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your code submission will be partly graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

Deadline: 1830h on Mon, 6 April

### 4.2 Feedback

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the form at [LMS -> Tests & Quizzes](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/jliIIV). This is due around the same time as the problem solutions.

Deadline: 1845h on Mon, 6 April

### 4.3 Peer Review

You will review 2 submissions which will be shared with you through [LMS -> Drop Box](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/4MonbN). The peer review rubric will be shared through [LMS -> Assignments](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/x0KvOt) where the review will have to be submitted.

Deadline: 1830h on Wed, 8 April

## Discussion

Please use the following avenues:
- discuss with your buddy
- post in the [class forum](https://habibedu.workplace.com/groups/464262444262573/)
- discuss with your peers
- talk to course staff in their desginated hours

## Refinements:
- Made lowercase, removed apostrophe, replaced punctuation with empty space in document_tokenize and query_tokenize in index.py because document is being tokenized with whitespace as a delimitter and some punctuation (e.g hyphen) joins words hence it is important to replace those punctuation with whitespace first.
- Stemmed words in index_preprocess and removed single characters. 
- Download nltk library for stop words and stemming. (If error arises in stopwords then first download them by uncommenting line 5 in Document.py)
