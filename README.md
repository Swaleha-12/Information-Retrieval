# Homework 4: Information Retrieval
# CS 201 Data Structures II, Spring 2020

-------

This homework explores information retrieval through implementations of trie and inverted index. 
Skeleton code is provided.

## Purpose

This homework provides insight into the trie and invertedindex data structures as well as into the field of information retrieval.

For this assignment, you should
- understand the trie data structure and its related operations
- understand the inverted index data structure and its related operations
- be comfortable with object oriented programming
- be comfortable with programming in a high level language, preferably python
- be able to problem solve

## The Problem Set

The problem set is present in the repository in both .tex and .pdf forms.

## Contribution
